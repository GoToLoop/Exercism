"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Enumerated constants can be done with a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).

# Possible sublist categories. Change the values as you see fit:
UNEQUAL, EQUAL, SUBLIST, SUPERLIST = -1, 0, 1, 2
