1. **Initialization**:
    - `UNITS` is a tuple containing metric system unit prefixes
    (e.g., kilo, mega, giga).
    - `BANDS` is a tuple containing color names representing resistor bands
    (e.g., black, brown, red, etc.).

2. **Function `vals(colors: list[str])`**:
    - Takes a list of color names (representing resistor bands) as input.
    - It uses the `map` function to apply the `BANDS.index` function to each
    color in the first three positions of the input list.
    - The result is a tuple containing the indices of the corresponding colors
    in the `BANDS` tuple, representing resistence ohm values.

3. **Function `label(c: list[str])`**:
    - This function takes a list of color names (representing resistor bands)
    as input.
    - It calculates the resistance value based on the color bands.
    - The resistance value is formed by concatenating:
        - The second color index (from `n`) multiplied by 10 raised to the
        power of the first color index (from `n`).
        - The third color index (from `n`) modulo 3, multiplied by '0'.
        - The appropriate unit prefix from `UNITS`.
        - The string 'ohms'.

4. **Local Variables in `label`**:
    - `n`: Tuple containing the indices of the first three colors.
    - `z`: A boolean indicating whether the second color index is zero (black).
    - `v`: The intermediate value representing the resistance value.
    - `zz`: The sum of `z` and the third color index (from `n`).

In summary, the `label` function calculates the resistance value based on the
input color bands & returns it as a string with the appropriate unit and 'ohms'.
