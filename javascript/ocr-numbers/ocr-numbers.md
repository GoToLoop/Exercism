# OCR Numbers JavaScript File Explanation

This JS file is about a challenge for a very simplified concept for an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of number digits inside a string, composed of pipes, spaces and underscores.

## Code Explanation

  * `// @ts-check`: This line enables TypeScript checking in JavaScript files when using Visual Studio Code as the editor.

  * `const { freeze: icy } = Object, { from } = Array, SPC = / +$/`: This line declares three constants:

     - `icy`: A reference to the `Object.freeze` method, which makes an object immutable.
     - `from`: A reference to the `Array.from` method, which creates a new array instance from an iterable object.
     - `SPC`: A regular expression that matches one or more space characters at the end of a string.

  * `cleanup = (ocr='') => ocr.replace(SPC, '')'replaceAll' + ''`: This is a function that removes trailing spaces and all newline characters from the input string. It takes an OCR string as input, removes trailing spaces using the replace method with the SPC regular expression, and then replaces all newline characters with an empty string using the replaceAll method.

  * `numDigits = ({ length=0 }) => length / 12 | 0`: This function takes a string length as input and returns the integer division of length by 12. This is used to calculate the number of digits in the OCR input.

  * `digitIdx = (num='', idx=0) => ~(idx = DIGITS.indexOf(num)) ? idx : '?'`: This function takes a digit string and an index as input. It assigns the index of the digit string in the DIGITS array to idx. If the digit string is found in the DIGITS array, it returns idx; otherwise, it returns '?'.

  * `multiScan = (ocr='') => icy(ocr.split(REGEX).map(str => icy(from({ length: rowSize(str) }, (_, i) => scanDigit(i, cleanup(str))))))`: This function takes an OCR string as input, splits it into lines using the REGEX regular expression, cleans up each line, scans each digit in the line, and returns an array of arrays of digits. The icy function is used to make the arrays immutable.

  * `REGEX = /(?<=\n\s{3,})\n/`: This is a regular expression used to split the OCR input into separate lines. It matches a newline character (\n) that is preceded by another newline character and at least three space characters. The (?<=...) syntax is a positive lookbehind assertion, which means the match must be preceded by the pattern inside the parentheses, but that pattern is not included in the match.

  * `OCR = ' _     _  _     _  _  _  _  _ ' + '| |  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|' + '|_|  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|'`: This is the OCR representation of the digits 0-9.

  * `DIGITS = icy(from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => scanDigit(i)))`: This line creates an array of the OCR representations of the digits 0-9.

  * `function scanDigit(pos=0, ocr=OCR) {...}`: This function scans a digit from the OCR input at a specified position. It does this by iterating over the OCR input in steps of cols (the number of columns in the OCR input), starting at the specified position, and concatenating the substrings of length 3 at each step to form the digit string:

    1. `const len = ocr.length, cols = len / 3 | 0, idx = pos * 3;`: This line declares three constants:

       - len: The length of the ocr string.
       - cols: The number of columns in the OCR input, calculated as the integer division of len by 3.
       - idx: The starting index for scanning the digit, calculated as pos * 3.

    2. `for (var num='', i = idx; i < len; i += cols) num += ocr.substr(i, 3);`: This for loop iterates over the ocr string in steps of cols, starting at idx. In each iteration, it appends a substring of length 3 starting at the current index i to the num string.

    3. `return num;`: This line returns the num string, which is the OCR representation of the digit at position pos.

  * `export function convert(ocr=OCR, lines = multiScan(ocr)) {...}`: This function converts the OCR input into a string of digits. It does this by iterating over the lines of digits returned by multiScan, converting each digit to its index in the DIGITS array using digitIdx, and concatenating the results with commas in between:

    1. `for (var val = '', i = 0; i < lines.length; val += ',')`: This for loop iterates over the lines array. In each iteration, it appends a comma to the val string.

    2. `for (const digit of lines[i++]) val += digitIdx(digit);`: This nested for loop iterates over the i-th line of lines. In each iteration, if found, it appends the index of the current digit in the DIGITS array to the val string, otherwise it appends '?'.

    3. `return val.slice(0, -1);`: This line returns the val string without the trailing comma. This is the final output of the function, which is a string of digits separated by commas. The digits are the indices of the OCR representations of the digits in the DIGITS array.
